This is an android group chat app where you can talk together in real time with your team, friends, coworkers etc. Just replace the google-services.json file with your file, allow as sing-in methods: e-mail &amp; password and anonymous. In the end create a database for your firebase profile, switch from cloud Firestore to RealTime Database and change the rules of read &amp; write data to true.
